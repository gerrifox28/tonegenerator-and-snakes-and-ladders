# tonegenerator-and-snakes-and-ladders
A two part project built for the DE1-SoC board that features a user interface to play the classic children's game of Snakes and Ladders with stellar sound features from the DE1-SoC board speaker and a tone generator that generates tones from C5-G6 using the DE1-SoC board speaker.
